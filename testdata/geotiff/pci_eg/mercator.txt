Mercator, NAD27

In EASI/PACE we have a "central meridian", which is corresponded with
the NatOriginLong value, and a "latitude of true scale" which is 
corresponded with the NatOriginLat.  We don't have a scale, so I am 
assuming that the scale is always 1.0 at the latitude of true scale.
We don't import Mercator if the scale is other than 1.0.

What is called CenterEasting and CenterNorthing in this projection is
just the normal FalseEasting and FalseNorthing in EASI/PACE.

Added Note, Jan/99:

According to the working notes on CT_Mercator, it is supposed to 
have the normal false northing and easting keys, not ProjCenterEasting
and ProjCenterNorthing.  Files generated by Oasis montaj (see ../from_gxf)
are correct in this regard, though PCI files are still generated 
incorrectly as below.
