		PCI GeoTIFF Samples
		-------------------

The following represent PCI GeoGateway generated GeoTIFF files for a
variety of projections, and a few datums.

Each .tif file has an associated .txt file showing the TIFF tags
(old output of listgeo), and the PCI (PROREP) projection report.  There
is also an .lgo file (modern listgeo output) for each file.
