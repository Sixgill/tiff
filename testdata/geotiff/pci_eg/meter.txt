Otherwise unspecified METER coordinates.  This is not a real projection,
but is form that ungeoreferenced images that do have local meter 
coordinates would be transported.  The key information to preserve from
this file is the coordinates of this file, and the fact that it is in
meters.

The GeographicTypeGeoKey specification of GCS_NAD27 is an artifact of
EASI/PACE and presumably should not be expected in this file.  Also the
GeogAngularUnitsGeoKey need not have been provided, as no angular units
are ever used.
