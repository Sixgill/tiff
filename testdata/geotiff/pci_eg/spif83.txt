State Plane (International Feet), NAD83

Note that the units of the projection coordinates are specified using
ProjLinearUnitsGeoKey.  In addition to Linear_Foot_US_Survey we also 
sometimes use Linear_Foot to indicate ``international feet'', or 
Linear_Meter to indicate that the units are in meters.  It seems that
we are supposed to convert the units and the tie point to the EPSG standard
for each zone; however, this is difficult, and contrary to how many users
want to work, so we always indicate a units override with the 
ProjLinearUnitsGeoKey.
