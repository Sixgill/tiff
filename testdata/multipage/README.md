# [Multipage tiff example for download â€“ test image file](http://www.nightprogrammer.org/development/multipage-tiff-example-download-test-image-file/)

Irfanview LogoRecently I was coding some functionality that was dealing with multipage tiff images. Since I hadn't any multipage pictures on my computer, I thought it shouldn't be too difficult to find some sample files to test with.

So I started my everday search in google: Multipage tiff example, multipage tiff file sample, multipage tif download etc. Nothing. Mostly results about programs that can handle multipage tiffs. Yay! Also google image search left me out in the rain :(. Screenshots of programs that can handle multipage tiffs. Yay, again!

After 30 minutes of searching, I decided to create my own multipage image. Started up [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) and tried to find an easy way. No luck. WTF! Then [irfanview](http://www.irfanview.net/) came to my mind - very handy when it comes to image viewing and Big multipage TIFF example imagemanipulaSmall multipage TIFF example imagetion. So I gave it  try and after 2 minutes I had my multipage tif :D!
